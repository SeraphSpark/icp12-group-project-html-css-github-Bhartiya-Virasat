            <h1>Lord Hanuman - The Embodiment of Devotion and Strength</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Introduction & Origins</h2>
                <p>Lord Hanuman is one of the most beloved deities in Hinduism, revered as a symbol of unwavering
                    devotion, physical strength, and divine courage. He is a central figure in the Indian epic Ramayana
                    and a devoted servant of Lord Rama. Born to Anjana and Kesari, and blessed by the wind god Vayu,
                    Hanuman is often referred to as the "son of the wind" (Pavanputra). His divine birth was destined to
                    serve the cause of dharma and aid Lord Rama in his mission to defeat the demon king Ravana. As a
                    Vanara (monkey-like being), Hanuman combines playful energy with supreme spiritual discipline. His
                    life and deeds are deeply spiritual yet humanly relatable, making him an enduring icon for millions.
                    Hanuman‚Äôs love for Rama is so intense and selfless that he became the very embodiment of Bhakti
                    (devotion), and through that love, he attained immortality and divine status across time and
                    tradition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Symbolism & Divine Powers</h2>
                <p>Hanuman‚Äôs appearance and attributes are filled with profound symbolic meaning. His monkey form
                    represents the untamed mind, which through devotion and discipline becomes a vehicle for divine
                    service. His immense strength is not just physical but also mental and spiritual ‚Äî capable of
                    overcoming ego, fear, and ignorance. Hanuman is known for his superhuman feats: leaping across
                    oceans, carrying mountains, changing size at will, and resisting dark forces with ease. These
                    abilities reflect his mastery over the elements and inner energies. His ever-folded hands and
                    lowered gaze reflect humility and surrender, despite his enormous power. The mace (gada) he holds
                    represents strength and dharma, while the image of Lord Rama in his heart shows his constant
                    remembrance of the divine. Hanuman‚Äôs celibacy (brahmacharya), fearlessness, and absolute loyalty
                    make him the ideal seeker ‚Äî disciplined, strong, and utterly surrendered to divine will. He is
                    worshipped as the remover of obstacles, protector from harm, and the destroyer of negative
                    influences.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Role in the Ramayana</h2>
                <p>In the Ramayana, Hanuman plays a pivotal role as the most trusted aide of Lord Rama. When Sita was
                    abducted by Ravana, Hanuman was the one who leapt across the ocean to reach Lanka, discovered her in
                    Ashok Vatika, and delivered Rama‚Äôs message. His journey is marked by trials, including facing
                    demons, resisting temptation, and displaying divine wisdom. He set Lanka ablaze with his tail,
                    warned Ravana of Rama‚Äôs wrath, and returned triumphantly to bring crucial information to Rama.
                    During the war, he brought the Sanjeevani mountain to revive Lakshmana, showcasing his compassion
                    and sense of urgency. Beyond his physical acts, Hanuman‚Äôs unwavering devotion becomes the emotional
                    and moral heart of the epic. Rama himself declares that he is eternally indebted to Hanuman. In
                    every moment ‚Äî whether carrying Rama on his shoulders or simply chanting his name ‚Äî Hanuman
                    exemplifies how love for God transforms even the impossible into reality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Spiritual Teachings & Bhakti</h2>
                <p>Hanuman is the ultimate symbol of Bhakti Yoga ‚Äî the path of devotion. His love for Rama is free of
                    ego, conditions, or personal gain. In the Hanuman Chalisa, composed by Tulsidas, he is praised for
                    his wisdom, valor, humility, and unwavering faith. Devotees recite the Chalisa to gain protection,
                    courage, and peace. Hanuman teaches that spiritual success lies not in rituals alone, but in sincere
                    surrender to the divine. His character urges seekers to cultivate strength, selflessness, and
                    discipline. He also represents the potential of every being to rise above limitations through divine
                    connection. His service is not out of duty but pure love ‚Äî a powerful reminder that serving God and
                    humanity with devotion is the highest path. Hanuman also transcends sectarianism; while a devotee of
                    Rama, he is respected by followers of Shiva, Vishnu, and Shakti alike, making him a unifying
                    spiritual force in Hindu tradition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Worship & Cultural Influence</h2>
                <p>Hanuman is worshipped across India and beyond with great devotion. Tuesdays and Saturdays are
                    especially dedicated to his worship, and temples dedicated to him are found in nearly every village
                    and city. He is believed to protect devotees from evil spirits, grant strength in adversity, and
                    remove planetary obstacles (especially those related to Shani). His images, often showing him
                    ripping open his chest to reveal Rama and Sita, or carrying a mountain, are powerful symbols of love
                    and service. From martial artists to spiritual seekers, Hanuman is a source of strength, focus, and
                    determination. Festivals like Hanuman Jayanti celebrate his birth with great fervor, including
                    recitation of scriptures, bhajans, and temple rituals. In art, literature, and performance ‚Äî from
                    Ramleela plays to modern cinema ‚Äî Hanuman continues to inspire courage and loyalty. His universal
                    appeal lies in his purity of purpose and his ability to uplift and protect anyone who seeks him with
                    faith.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Conclusion ‚Äì The Eternal Devotee</h2>
                <p>Lord Hanuman is more than a divine hero ‚Äî he is the inner strength in every human soul striving to
                    serve truth, love, and righteousness. His life teaches that even the most powerful being becomes
                    divine only through humility and surrender. He reminds us that true greatness lies in service, and
                    real courage comes from faith. Whether we seek strength in hardship, guidance in confusion, or
                    protection from harm, Hanuman answers every sincere call. He dwells in the hearts of those who chant
                    the name of Rama, and his presence brings clarity, energy, and unwavering resolve. To walk with
                    Hanuman is to walk with fearless devotion ‚Äî grounded in love, guided by dharma, and empowered by
                    divine grace. In every leap of faith, every selfless act, and every prayer whispered in difficulty,
                    the spirit of Hanuman lives on ‚Äî eternal, unshakable, and ever-blessing.</p>
