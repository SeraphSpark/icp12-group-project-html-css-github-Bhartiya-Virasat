# Bhartiya Virasat – The Indian Heritage 🇮🇳

**Bhartiya Virasat** is a simple and meaningful web-based project dedicated to exploring and celebrating India's rich and diverse heritage. It brings together the timeless stories, teachings, and achievements of Indian gods, saints, warriors, philosophers, scientists, and freedom fighters, and presents them in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.

This project is inspired by the idea of keeping India's cultural soul alive in the hearts of every generation. From epic tales in the Ramayana and Mahabharata to historical figures like Rani Lakshmibai and Maharana Pratap, and from spiritual leaders like Swami Vivekananda and Guru Nanak to ancient minds like Aryabhatta and Panini—this website is a digital tribute to those who have shaped India's identity.

## 🌸 What You’ll Find

The homepage welcomes users with the idea of "India's Living Heritage" and invites them to explore multiple categories:

- **Divine Tales** – Stories and symbolism of Indian gods and goddesses such as Lord Shiva, Krishna, Durga, Ganesha, and others.
- **Legends of the Land** – Historical heroes who fought with bravery and led with honor.
- **Ancient Minds** – Indian mathematicians, scientists, and thinkers who contributed to global knowledge.
- **Spiritual Souls** – Saints and spiritual teachers whose wisdom continues to inspire millions.
- **Unsung Freedom Fighters** – Brave men and women who contributed to India’s independence but are often forgotten.
